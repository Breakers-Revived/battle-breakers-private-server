## About The Game

Battle Breakers was a cartoon-themed Hero collector, Turn-Based, and Action RPG game developed by Chair Entertainment
and Epic Games in 2014-2019. Released in beta in 2016 and launched in 2019, the game has since been shut down at the end
of 2022.

## About This Project

This project is a **complete reimplementation** of every Epic Games backend service required to run and play the game
(AKA: Private Server, Server Emulator, Game Server, etc.). It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original
game servers, allowing the game to be played as it was when it was live.
It strives to be as complete and accurate as possible, to preserve the game and its legacy. It aims to be **fully
compatible** with all versions of the game, on all platforms, from the 2017 beta to the final release.

[This project](https://github.com/dippyshere/battle-breakers-private-server) would not have been possible
without [the data](https://github.com/dippyshere/battle-breakers-documentation) [I](https://github.com/dippyshere)
captured, the help and data provided by [Lele](https://github.com/LeleDerGrasshalmi/) and
his [Epic Games Documentation](https://github.com/LeleDerGrasshalmi/FortniteEndpointsDocumentation/), and the combined
game knowledge of the [Battle Breakers community](https://discord.gg/3Hpv72hvvx).

## Project Goals

- [x] **Fully Compatible**: The server should be able to support all versions of the game, from the 2017 beta to the
  final release.
