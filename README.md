## About

Battle Breakers was a cartoon-themed Hero collector, Turn-Based, and Action RPG game developed by Chair Entertainment
and Epic Games. Released in beta in 2016 and launched in 2019, the game has since been shut down at the end of 2022.

This project is a **complete reimplementation** of every Epic Games backend service required to run and play the game.
It strives to be as complete and accurate as possible, to preserve the game and its legacy. It aims to be **fully
compatible** with all versions of the game, on all platforms, from the 2017 beta to the final release.

[This project](https://github.com/dippyshere/battle-breakers-private-server) would not have been possible
without [the data](https://github.com/dippyshere/battle-breakers-documentation) [I](https://github.com/dippyshere)
captured, the help and data provided by [Lele](https://github.com/LeleDerGrasshalmi/) and
his [Epic Games Documentation](https://github.com/LeleDerGrasshalmi/FortniteEndpointsDocumentation/), and the combined
game knowledge of the [Battle Breakers community](https://discord.gg/3Hpv72hvvx).
